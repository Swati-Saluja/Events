A Web App where users would be able to see upcoming events related to entertainment, eg., movies, concerts, etc. in their desired location, based on the miles and date range selected by them. Eventful API has been used here, to meld the data.
Once the users have made an account and logged in, they get an opportunity to rate the Event based on their interest, after the results are displayed. 
They would get a detailed information on the selected Event regarding the dates, timings, exact location, etc.
